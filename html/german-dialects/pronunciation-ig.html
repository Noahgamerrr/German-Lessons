      <h1>Pronunciations of "ig" in different regions</h1>
      <h6>13<sup>th</sup> July 2021</h6>
      <section>
        <p>There are different dialects throughout the German-speaking countries
          and of course, different dialects mean different pronunciation rules.
          I usually teach you about Austrian German, but since this subject has
          got to do with the Austrian dialects, I thought that it would be
          interesting to talk with you about that. Today, I want to talk about
          the suffix “-ig”, which, based on the region, can have 3 different pronunciations:</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>/iç/ [like “ich”] in northern and in central Germany</p>
        <p>/ik/ in southern Germany, Austria and in Switzerland</p>
        <p>/iʃ/ [like “isch] in West Middle Germany and in Saxony</p>
      </section>
      <section class="section-with-img">

        <p>The Duden pronunciation dictionary states that the /iç/ pronunciation the
          correct one is, even though this rule does not apply regularly for the middle
          of the word. For example, you should say “köniklich” and “ewiklich” but then
          again “wenichstens”, “zwanzichste” and “ewichkeit”</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 15px;">In the south, there are some regions where you might
          find the /iç/ pronunciation (Even though it is pretty rare). That is of course due to the spread of Standard
          German
          and of mass media. However, the traditionally southern /ik/ pronunciation has also
          found its way to the north, to Hannover, Hamburg, Berlin etc.. Reasons for that are the inconsequent norm (So
          is for
          example the correct pronunciation of “Tag” /taːk/ and not /taç/), but also the
          orthography, which lets people think that /tak/ would be the correct pronunciation,
          even though it is not.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>As you might have noticed, in the regions of the Rhineland, Hesse and Palatinate, the /ik/
          pronunciation is also surprisingly common. This is due to a phenomenon called “hypercorrection”.
          There, where people try to avoid the /iʃ/ pronunciation, it is much easier to pronounce it as /ik/
          instead of /iç/.</p>
