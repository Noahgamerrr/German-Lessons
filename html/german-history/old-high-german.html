                    Old High German specifies the oldest form of German from which we have written evidence.
                    Of course, there are older versions of the German language. Since we don't have any evidence of them, however,
                    we can't tell much about them.

                    Old High German was spoken around 750-1050 AD. The German word for German "deutsch" comes from the Old High German
                    word "diutisc" meaning "Belonging to the people."

                <h2>Where was Old High German spoken?</h2>
                <p>
                    Old High German wasn't a uniformed language, but rather a group of dialects within the West-Germanic languages.
                    Other West-Germanic languages include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Old Dutch Varieties</li>
                        <li>Old Frisian Varieties</li>
                        <li>Old Saxon Varieties</li>
                        <li>Old English Varieties</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The difference in these dialect groups lies in the implementation of the great vowel shifts that happened
                    during that time. Old High German is a result of the second vowel shift, which made it differ from the other
                    dialect groups that didn't implement these changes (Collected into the Old Low German dialects). Newer vowel shifts
                    resulted in the Old High German language being split up into the Germanic branch (spoken in Germany), the
                    Austro-Bavarian branch (spoken in Bavaria/Austria) and the Alemannic branch (spoken in Switzerland, 
                    Baden-Wuerttemberg and in Vorarlberg.)

            <section>
                <p>But since back then, there wasn't a uniformed language, there were many texts that differed in vocabulary,
                    orthography etc. They still got grouped together into "Old High German", even though a classification in their own branches
                    would have been more fitting.

                <h2>Orthography</h2>
                <p>
                    Old High German writers implemented the Latin script into their language. However, there were abundant
                    letters (like &lt;v&gt; and &lt;f&gt;), and then there were sounds that didn't have their proper letter.
                    (like /pf/, /ts/, /tʃ/ and /ç/) which had to be written. The phoneme /f/ used to be written with an &lt;f&gt;
                    in Old High German, like in fihu (Vieh; cattle), filu (viel, much), fior (vier; four). etc. Then, in Middle
                    High German, people started to write with the &lt;v&gt;, so vinsternis (Finsternis; Darkness), vrouwe (Frau; woman)
                    or vriunt (Freund; friend) were used. This confusion still goes to show in today's German language, where some words
                    use &lt;f&gt; and some use &lt;v&gt; to express the same phoneme /f/.

                <h2>Lecture in Old High German</h2>
                <p>There aren't many texts in Old High German. The most famous ones include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Abrogans (Latin-Old High German Glossar)</li>
                    <li>Hildebrandlied</li>
                    <li>Mooseburger Zauberspr&uuml;che</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Most texts from that time are based on religion or alchemy.

                <h2>Grammar</h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, Old High German is a synthetic language, meaning that a lot of information is conveyed through
                    inflection.

                <h3>Umlaut</h3>
                <p>
                    It is important to know, that in Old High German, there was something called a "primary Umlaut". That means that
                    if the following syllable contains an /i/ or a /j/-sound, the vowels /a/ and /e/ will transform in an Umlaut. You
                    can still see that change today, in German's plural forms and in it's perfect/preterit-forms.

                <h3>Last syllables</h3>
                <p>
                    Contrary to today's German, in Old High German, the last syllables were still fully pronounced, like for example:
                </p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Old High German</th>
                        <th>German</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>mahhôn</td>
                        <td>machen</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>taga</td>
                        <td>Tage</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>demo</td>
                        <td>dem</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>perga</td>
                        <td>Berge</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>
                    The weakening of the last syllable took place around 1050, and is seen as the boundary between Old High German
                    and Middle High German.

                <h3>Nouns</h3>
                <p>
                    Nouns in general have four cases (Nominative, Genitive, Dative, Accusative), and there are some remainings of
                    and instrumental case. And there's the difference between a strong declension (vocal declension) and a weak declension
                    (consonantal declension).

                <h3>Verbs</h3>
                <p>
                    With verbs, there is also a distinction between a strong vocal conjugation and a weak consonantal conjugation.
                    Even though there were always more weaker verbs than stronger, the group of the latter one was much higher back then
                    then it is now. Within strong verbs, there is a changement in the vocal in the main morphem which holds the lexical
                    meaning of the word, while within weak verbs, the difference only lies in the last syllable.

                <h3>Tense</h3>
                <p>
                    In the Germanic language, there are mainly two tenses: The past tense and the non-past tense. However, with the
                    translation of Latin texts, the other Latin tenses, the perfect, the pluperfect, the future I and the future II,
                    began to be develop in writing. The perfect tense began to be used in colloquial speech, and that changement continued
                    in Middle High German.

                <h3>Pronunciation</h3>
                <p>
                    The pronunciation of Old High German is based off of comparisons between traditional texts and the pronunciation of
                    Standard German, German dialects and similar languages.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In general, vowels are to be pronounced short, except when there a macron or a circumflex on top of it. Only in
                        New High German, vowels in open syllables are streched.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Diphthongs ei, ou, uo, ua, ie, ia, io and iu are pronounced as Diphthongs and the stress falls on the first vowel.
                        It's worth pointing out that sometimes, the letter &lt;v&gt; sometimes has got the phonetic value of /u/.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The stress always lies on the root, even if one of the following syllables contains a long vowel.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The phonetic values of the most consonant letters is the same as in today's German. The only difference is that the letters
                        &lt;b&gt;, &lt;d&gt; and &lt;g&gt; are voiced even at the end of words, while Middle High German, they become unvoiced.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The graph &lt;th&gt; is to be pronounced /&eth;/ (like in english: the). At around 830, it can be read as /d/ however.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        &lt;c&gt; is to be pronounced /k/, even if you read &lt;sc&gt;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        &lt;z&gt; is ambiguous and can stand for /ts/, but also /s/
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        &lt;h&gt; as the initial sound is pronounced /h/, as a medial or final sound, it's pronounced /x/
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        &lt;st&gt; is pronouned /st/ also in the initial sound, whereas today, it is rather pronounced /ʃt/
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        &lt;ng&gt; is pronounced /ng/, not /ŋ/
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        &lt;qu&gt; is pronounced like in today's German /kv/.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        &lt;uu&gt; (often transcribed as &lt;w&gt;) is pronounced like the english &lt;w&gt;.
                    </li>
