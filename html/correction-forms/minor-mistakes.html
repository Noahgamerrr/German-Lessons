        <h1>Correction of the "Minor mistakes" form</h1>
        <h6>11<sup>th</sup> September 2021</h6>
        <section>
          <p>Some days ago, I made a survey about some minor mistakes in the German
            language. (Even though some of them weren’t that minor but never mind!).
            There were 7 participants who have accomplished an average of 2,4/5 points
            (48,57%, also note that there is no judgement or anything). So, what
            are the five mistakes? Let’s start with the first sentence:</p>
        </section>
        <hr>
        <section>
          <ol>
            <li>Ich hoffe, ihn zu wiedersehen.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>This one is a pretty big mistake and mistakes like that are made only
            by learners. So, what is the correct answer? It is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ich hoffe, ihn <b>wiederzusehen</b></li>
          </ul>
          <p><b><u>RULE:</u></b> Usually with the “zu + Infinitiv” the “zu” part
            comes before the infinitive. However, if the infinitive is composed
            of two words (“wiedersehen” is composed of “wieder” and “sehen”), then
            the “zu” part comes in between those two words.</p>
          <p>Now that we know this rule, let’s go on to the next mistake:</p>
        </section>
        <hr>
        <section>
          <ol start="2">
            <li>Wie dem auch ist, ich kann da nichts für.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Some of you thought that the separation of “da” and “für” would be
            wrong, but that’s not the case. In fact, yes, “Ich kann nichts dafür”
            is the most correct form, however, in colloquial speech, “Ich kann da
            nichts für” is also totally fine. The real mistake is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Wie dem auch <b>sei</b>, ich kann da nichts für.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><b><u>RULE:</u></b> Unfortunately, there is no real rule for that.
            You just have to remember the phrases in which you have to use the
            conjunctive I mood.</p>
        </section>
        <hr>
        <section>
          <ol start="3">
            <li>General De Gaulle leistete in Frankreich Wiederstand gegen das NS-Regime.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>This sentence right here is interesting, because this mistake is also
            common even among natives, even though the grammar point behind it is
            not that hard. The correct sentence is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>General De Gaulle leistete in Frankreich <b>Widerstand</b> gegen das NS-Regime.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><b><u>RULE:</u></b> wieder-” means to do something again, it’s like
            the English “re-” prefix. “wider-” on the other hand means more something
            like “against, anti-, contra etc.”</p>
        </section>
        <hr>
        <section>
          <ol start="4">
            <li>Etwas großes kommt auf uns zu.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>This mistake right here is pretty common among natives so don’t feel
            embarrassed if you didn’t get this one right. Even I get that sometimes
            wrong. The problem here is small. The correct sentence is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Etwas <b>Großes</b> kommt auf uns zu.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><b><u>RULE:</u></b> If a declined adjective follows an indefinite
            quantifier (nichts, viel, wenig, alles, etwas etc.), this adjective
            is written with a capital letter (same goes for participles btw.)</p>
        </section>
        <hr>
        <section>
          <p>Last but not least:</p>
          <ol start="5">
            <li>Mein Sohn Jonas spielt mit dem roten großen Ball.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Well, I just found out that I messed this one up, the mistake is a
            different than I had thought. Even though, my original thought:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Mein Sohn Jonas spielt mit dem <b>großen roten</b> Ball</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Isn’t wrong either. The actual mistake is there needs to be a comma
            between the two adjectives. So, I won’t count this one, if anyone wants
            their result to be checked again, please contact me via Discord. You
            should have got me in your DMs. There is not really a rule about the
            order of adjectives as there is in English. However, there is still an
            interesting rule which I want to share with you:</p>
          <p><b><u>RULE:</u></b> If two adjectives are equal, that means that they
            have the same relationship to the adjective, there needs to be a comma.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Mein Sohn Jonas spielt mit dem großen, roten Ball.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>However, if they are not equal, that means if a fixed relationship
            between an adjective and a substantive is being more precisely determined
            by another adjective, there doesn’t need to be a comma, however, the
            latter needs to stand <b>before</b> the fixed adjective-substantive
            combination. For example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Er war ein berühmter französischer Schauspieler.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Here is a fixed relationship between “französischer” and “Schauspieler”
            (it is an undoubtable fact that the actor is French) which is being
            more precisely determined by “berühmter” (Being a French actor doesn’t
            make him automatically famous).</p>

        <section>
          <p>So, there you have it, those are the 5 mistakes (4 real mistakes and
            1 by my stupidity) I wanted to share with you. I will make something
            like that again but with mistakes in the range A1-B1 and I will make
            sure that I don’t make any mistakes by myself.</p>
